# MusicTreequence
MusicTreequence is a Python library to code music. It provides an abstraction layer on top of [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/), which in turn is a front end to [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io/). MusicTreequence produces Ruby code that can be processes by Sonic Pi, that is, if you want to listen to what you've coded with MusicTreequence you have to install Sonic Pi, which is cross-platform, free and open source.
## Listen to the Music
For an easy start
 1. code some music (have a look at the small [Tutorial](./Tutorial.ipynb) for a start) and write it to a file called 'song.rb'
 1. open [main.rb](./main.rb) in Sonic Pi
 1. adapt the path to 'song.rb' to the directory where you've just saved your music
 1. run [main.rb](./main.rb)
